Sends customers a link to create a password rather than auto-generating a password for them.

== Description ==

If your site auto-generates customer credentials, then they receive their username and password in plaintext in their email.

To improve security and make the experience a bit more user-friendly, this plugin sends users a link to create their password, much like WordPress core does when you add a new user account.

== Installation ==

1. Install the plugin.
1. If you&rsquo;ve customized the customer-new-account.php template file in your theme, copy the template from this plugin over to your theme folder and make the edits necessary.

== Screenshots ==

1. Sample new customer email
